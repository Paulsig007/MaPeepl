# MaPeepl Employee Tracker

## Badges

## Description

This project thoroughly tracks the employees of a given company, including their title, salary, manager and department they belong to. The user is allowed to View all employees, roles, and departments, add new employess, new roles and departments as well as edit the roles of current employees. This project was very satisfying to complete and possibly one of my most organized projects to date.

Once the node modules are downloaded the user should create the database and seed it with the given seeds.sql file. Then the user will be allowed to run the node index.js command in their terminal, and they will be given full force of the functionality of this most excellent employee tracker. The user is prompted with "What would you like to do?" and they are presented with myriad options including but not limited to adding new employess, seeing all of the departments in a beautifully rendered table, as well as updating a current employee's role, should they recieve a promotion or transfer. Once the user is finished they need only select the "Quit" option where they will be left with a kind farewell, leaving them only wanting more time with this most perfect employee tracker.
